    description: 'ROBOEXPO is an annual event organized by the Robotics club of SIT CORSIT. The primary objective is to introduce the club and its activities to the newcomers by displaying the bots that the members have created over the year. The event showcases various bots such as Line Follower Robots (LFR), Roboracer, Gesture controlled bots, Bluetooth controlled bots, etc. The exhibition provides students with an opportunity to witness and understand the workings of these bots up close. It serves as an excellent platform for the Robotics club to attract new members who are interested in this field.',
